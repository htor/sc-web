SuperCollider in the browser

## installation

This project requires [JACK](http://jackaudio.org/) to be installed. First install that, then:

```
npm install
```

## usage

Make sure JACK is already running, then to start up the editor run:

```
npm start
```

Now open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your favourite browser.
It needs to have permission to play audio, so give it that.

Now, send code to SuperCollider with Alt + Enter and get sound back.
