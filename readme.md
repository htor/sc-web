# scweb

SuperCollider in the browser.

# usage

This app requires [JACK](http://jackaudio.org/) to be installed. First install and start it and then run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your favourite browser.
It needs to have permission to play audio, so [give it that](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/block-autoplay)
and refresh the page. Now you can send code to SC with Alt + Enter and get sound back.
